# LineupManager
This is a Graphical User Interface to manage the lineup in sport games (futsal, but can be generalized)
The language used in this program is a mixture of English and Dutch.

User guide:
- Create a file 'spelers.txt' that lists all player names in the same fashion as is done in 'spelers_voorbeeld.txt'.

To Do:
- Make sure that no 2 outliers in speelbeurten are removed if the second half hasn't started yet.
- Allow to load an instance of wedstrijd from the history.
- Incorporate history line in dashboard and allow for edits.
