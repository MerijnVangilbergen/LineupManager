This is a GUI to manage the lineup in sport games (in this case futsal, but can be generalized)
The language used in this program is a mixture of English and Dutch.

This version was used as a first test.

- During start-up, I forgot to enter one name and I couldn't add it without restarting the program.
- The program collects time data which can be useful for post-game analysis, but it gave little insights during the game. Adding colours and position ordering should decrease the time needed to gain insights.
- A few silent substitutes occurred (were not entered in the dashboard). It could be because the players, rather than a coach or fan, were responsible to manage the display. Still, it's worth looking into improving the ease of entering substitutes.
- When we reached half-time or the end of the game, I didn't have any visuals to show. I could generate a pie chart of minutes played or a histogram of play durations.
- After the game, a player proposed to always have one player ready for substitution for each position on the field. This raises the idea to make the dashboard visualize the 5 positions on the field and make a reservation slot for each. I think it would be nice if we could drag players from the bench to the reservation spot.
